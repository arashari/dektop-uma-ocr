# Umamusume Event Helper

A modern desktop application built with Tauri for extracting event text from Umamusume Pretty Derby and displaying choice outcomes.

## Features

- **Self-Contained Executable**: No external dependencies required
- **Floating Window**: Always-on-top draggable window that stays above the game
- **Screen Capture**: Click and drag to select event dialog areas  
- **Built-in OCR**: English text extraction using bundled Tesseract
- **Event Database**: SQLite database with choice outcomes
- **Native Performance**: Rust backend with web frontend
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows, macOS, and Linux support

## Quick Start

### Download & Run

1. **Download** the latest release for your platform
2. **Run** the executable - no installation needed
3. **Grant permissions** when prompted for screen capture

### Usage

1. **Launch the app** â†’ Small floating window appears
2. **Position the window** anywhere on screen (it stays above the game)
3. **When an event appears in Umamusume** â†’ Click "ðŸ“· Capture Event"
4. **Select the event dialog area** â†’ Click and drag over the event text
5. **View the results** â†’ All choice outcomes are displayed
6. **Make your choice** in the game based on the displayed effects

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install system dependencies (Linux)
sudo apt-get install webkit2gtk-4.0-dev build-essential curl wget libssl-dev libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev

# Install system dependencies (macOS)
# Xcode Command Line Tools are required
```

### Build Commands

```bash
# Development build
cargo tauri dev

# Production build

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Rust with Tauri framework
- **OCR**: Tesseract-rs (bundled, no external installation)
- **Database**: SQLite with Rusqlite
- **Screen Capture**: Screenshots crate
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Build System**: Cargo + Tauri CLI

## Key Benefits

- **No Dependencies**: Everything bundled in single executable
- **Small Size**: ~15-25MB total application size
- **Fast Performance**: Native Rust backend
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface
- **Always Updated**: Built-in updater support
- **Secure**: Sandboxed execution environment

## Database Structure

The app creates an SQLite database (`uma_events.db`) with:
- Event names and descriptions
- Choice options and their stat effects
- Outcome data for informed decision-making

Events can be added by modifying the Rust source code or through future UI additions.

## System Requirements

- **Windows**: Windows 10 or later
- **macOS**: macOS 10.15 or later  
- **Linux**: Modern Linux distribution with GTK 3.24+

## Troubleshooting

**App won't start:**
- Check if you have required system libraries
- Run from terminal to see error messages

**Screen capture not working:**
- Grant screen recording permissions when prompted
- On macOS: System Preferences â†’ Security & Privacy â†’ Screen Recording

**OCR accuracy issues:**
- Ensure event text is clearly visible
- Try capturing a larger area around the text
- Works best with high-contrast, clear text

## Development

This is a Tauri application combining Rust backend performance with modern web frontend flexibility. The app is designed to be:

- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage
- **Responsive**: Fast OCR and database queries  
- **Maintainable**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new features

## Support
